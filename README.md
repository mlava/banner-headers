This extension allows you to define a banner image to use as a header on an individual page level.

Simply create a block anywhere on the page in the form:

banner: url

where url is a link to a web image.

The extension will scan each page as you navigate to it, and if it finds a banner: url definition somewhere on the page it will create the banner.

Banner height is configurable in Roam Depot settings, but defaults to 150px.
